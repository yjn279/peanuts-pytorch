# Model Architectures

The project implements several neural network architectures for seismic phase detection, all located in [peanuts/models/](mdc:peanuts/models).

## Available Models

- **[phase_net.py](mdc:peanuts/models/phase_net.py)**: Original PhaseNet architecture for seismic phase picking
- **[attention_unet.py](mdc:peanuts/models/attention_unet.py)**: U-Net with attention mechanisms
- **[r2_unet.py](mdc:peanuts/models/r2_unet.py)**: R2 U-Net variant with recurrent residual blocks
- **[r2a_unet.py](mdc:peanuts/models/r2a_unet.py)**: R2 U-Net with attention gates

## Model Configuration

Models are selected via configuration in [config/train.yaml](mdc:config/train.yaml):

```yaml
model:
  name: PhaseNet  # or AttentionUNet, R2UNet, R2AUNet
  epochs: 10
  path: ""  # for pre-trained weights
  freezing_layers: 10
  fine_tuning: false
  transfer_learning: false
```

## Model Import System

Models are imported via [peanuts/models/__init__.py](mdc:peanuts/models/__init__.py) and instantiated dynamically using `eval(config.model.name)()` in the training script.

## Architecture Focus

All models are designed for:
- **Input**: 3-channel seismic waveforms (Z, N, E components)
- **Output**: Phase probability predictions (P, S, noise)
- **Task**: Semantic segmentation for time-series phase detection
